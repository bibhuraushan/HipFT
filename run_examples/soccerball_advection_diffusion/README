Soccer Ball Advection Diffusion Example
---------------------------------------

This run uses the built-in analytic validation mode of HipFT
to run the "Soccer Ball" solution
(see https://www.chebfun.org/examples/sphere/SphereHeatConduction.html).

The solution is for diffusion, but here we also add a 
ridged rotation velocity in the phi direction
to rotate the solution as its diffusing around exactly one revolution.

Therefore, the final output should match the diffused solution.

The `zero.h5` input file is only used as a resolution template
to set the resolution of the run (1024x512).

To run the test (assuming you have set HIPFT_HOME env variable to the base repo):

First, copy the files to a new temporary directory to run in.
Then, in that directory, run the code with:


    mpiexec -np 1 ${HIPFT_HOME}/src/hipft 1>hipft.log 2>hipft.err


When the run is completed, you can plot the code's final
output and the outputted analytic solution with:


    ${HIPFT_HOME}/bin/plot2d -tp -ll -finegrid -cmin -1000 -cmax 1000 hipft_brmap_final.h5
    ${HIPFT_HOME}/bin/plot2d -tp -ll -finegrid -cmin -1000 -cmax 1000 hipft_brmap_final_analytic.h5 


To see the validation, run the history plotter as:


    ${HIPFT_HOME}/bin/hipft_plot_histories.py -valrun


The resulting history_val.png should look oscillatory 
(since the solution is symmetric over partial rotations.)
