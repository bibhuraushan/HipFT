DEV TASKS FOR HIPFT:

 - Conflow realizations: May be multiple flow map file sets, or with later auto-gen, seed or other conflow parameters - or possibly longitude shifts?

 - Write more documentation (mkdocs? git io? doxygen?)


LATER

 - Add cross-linking of hipft and conflow for convective flow generation
   (and GPU-compatible)
