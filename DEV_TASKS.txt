DEV TASKS FOR HIPFT:

 - Add namelist for input instead of (or combined with) command line
 - Remove parse module if no longer needed after namelist implementation
 - Add interleaved data input vs. output option
 - Add initial dump time option
 - Make python script to generate hipft history diagnostics from a series of hipft output maps
   (can then use to get polar fluxes as function of lat limit, etc.)
 - Implement time-dept flow input in same manner as magnetic field input
   - Meta data csv file read
   - Time step setting based on input cadence
   - Reading data and setting flow - activate re-calc of CFL, etc.
     (Linear interp in time between inputs?)
 - Add MPI code from Miko to allow multiple realizations
   - Basic multi-map 3D data across ranks
   - Make some parameters 1D arrays to allow instance variations
     (With conflow, may be multiple flow map file sets, or with later
      auto-gen, seed or other conflow parameters)
 - Add cross-linking of hipft and conflow for convective flow generation
   once conflow is in a good state (and GPU-compatible)
 - Make better build mechanism (similar to pot3d)
 - Make testsuite/examples package
 - Write documentation (mkdocs? git io?)

 - Update history plot script to allow UT time input for HipFT time "0"
   for use with plot axis (and add plot axis format options)
