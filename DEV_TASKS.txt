DEV TASKS FOR HIPFT:

 - Make velocity attenuation a 1D array across realizations.
 - Make other parameters 1D arrays to allow instance variations
     (With conflow, may be multiple flow map file sets, or with later
      auto-gen, seed or other conflow parameters)

 - Cleanup python script to generate hipft history diagnostics from a series of hipft output maps
 - Update history plot script to allow UT time input for HipFT time "0"
   for use with plot axis (and add plot axis format options)
 - Make better build mechanism (similar to pot3d)
 - Make testsuite and more examples
 - Write documentation (mkdocs? git io?)
 - Write script to generate butterfly diagram from series of HipFT output maps.
   Can use initial UT time and map output text file to get times.
   Need to do average of CR (so find idx range for each one) and add to diagram map.

LATER
 - Add interleaved data input vs. output option (?)
 - Add initial dump time option
 - Add cross-linking of hipft and conflow for convective flow generation
   once conflow is in a good state (and GPU-compatible)
