DEV TASKS FOR HIPFT:

 - Add namelist for input instead of (or combined with) command line
 - Remove parse module if no longer needed after namelist implementation
 - Add interleaved data input vs. output option
 - Add initial dump time option
 - Make python script to generate hipft history diagnostics from a series of hipft output maps
   (can then use to get polar fluxes as function of lat limit, etc.)
 - Add MPI code from Miko to allow multiple realizations
   - Basic multi-map 3D data across ranks
   - Make some parameters 1D arrays to allow instance variations
     (With conflow, may be multiple flow map file sets, or with later
      auto-gen, seed or other conflow parameters)
 - Add cross-linking of hipft and conflow for convective flow generation
   once conflow is in a good state (and GPU-compatible)
 - Make better build mechanism (similar to pot3d)
 - Make testsuite/examples package
 - Write documentation (mkdocs? git io?)

 - Update history plot script to allow UT time input for HipFT time "0"
   for use with plot axis (and add plot axis format options)

 - Write script to generate butterfly diagram from series of HipFT output maps.
   Can use initial UT time and map output text file to get times.
   Need to do average of CR (so find idx range for each one) and add to diagram map.
