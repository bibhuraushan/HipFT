DEV TASKS FOR HIPFT:

 - Continue parameter 1D arrays to allow instance variations
   To do:
   - Conflow: may be multiple flow map file sets, or with later auto-gen, seed or other conflow parameters
   - Analytic flow profile params (3 for meridianal, 3 for differential rotation - maybe 5 for each...)

 - Cleanup the python script that generates hipft history diagnostics from a series of hipft output maps

 - Update history plot script to allow UT time input for HipFT time "0"
   for use with plot axis (and add plot axis format options) [Miko]

 - Update history compare script to allow N history files with a more automatic way to specify them (realizations).

 - Make testsuite:  Small map versions of standard runs

 - Write documentation (mkdocs? git io?)

 - Write script to generate butterfly diagram from series of HipFT output maps.
   Can use initial UT time and map output text file to get times.
   Need to do average of CR (or any time) (so find idx range for each one) and add to diagram map.
   IN PROGRESS!

LATER

 - Add cross-linking of hipft and conflow for convective flow generation
   (and GPU-compatible)
